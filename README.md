# Zernike3D_Phantom_Data

This repository includes the binaries and metadatas needed to import the Phantom data processed in the supplementary material of [1]. The dataset is ready to be imported inside Scipion using the standard importing protocol.

Two different dataset of particles are included:
* A small dataset of 225 particles, representing 5 different conformations simulated from a CCT complex. This main purpose of the dataset is to evaluate the characteristics of the Zernike3D and ZART algorithms under ideal conditions.
* A bigger dataset of 700 particles, corrupted with different levels of Gaussian noise to evaluate the robustness of the Zernike3D method under different situations.
